# Knitting-machine
Designed, developed, and constructed an automated knitting machine consisting of a 3D printed, two-servo-controlled, robot arm and a DC motor-powered rotating loom. The three motors are controlled using an Arduino Uno and programmed on Microchip Studio IDE using embedded C, AVR C, where we directly manipulated the registers of the Atmega328 to implement automation controls.
